"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .",pos
"for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .",pos
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .,pos
"the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .",pos
"in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .",pos
"if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .",pos
"getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?",pos
"the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .",pos
"it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .",pos
"when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .",pos
"abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .",pos
"upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .",pos
"i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .",pos
"in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .",pos
"it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .",pos
"and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .",pos
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .,pos
"now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .",pos
"the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .",pos
oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .,pos
"even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .",pos
"ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .",pos
"i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .",pos
"the film , however , is all good .",pos
"2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content",pos
"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .",pos
"mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .",pos
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?,pos
the plot is deceptively simple .,pos
george washington carver high school is having student elections .,pos
"tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .",pos
"mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .",pos
"and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .",pos
"the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .",pos
"you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .",pos
"_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .",pos
"what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .",pos
the similarities are staggering :,pos
"tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",pos
"max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",pos
the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .,pos
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .,pos
"tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .",pos
"max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive .",pos
"the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .",pos
he even gets a bee sting .,pos
"the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .",pos
he gets several bee stings .,pos
and so on .,pos
what happened ?,pos
"how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?",pos
"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .",pos
"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .",pos
witherspoon is a revelation .,pos
"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .",pos
"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .",pos
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .,pos
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .,pos
"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .",pos
"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .",pos
"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .",pos
"call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .",neg
"i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .",neg
"even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .",neg
i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .,neg
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .,neg
"i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .",neg
"his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .",neg
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .,neg
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .,neg
"she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .",neg
this continues for what seems like 6 hours .,neg
"the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end .",neg
"unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .",neg
"though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .",neg
"on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .",neg
fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .,neg
"concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support .",neg
"also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence .",neg
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .,neg
"when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil .",neg
"you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid . """,neg
"note to screenwriters and self : when you hit the big time , and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer , tell ? em all to hit the road .",neg
"gilligan wrote the arbitrarily-titled home fries ten years ago ; it was shelved until he found success as one of "" the took a second look at gilligan's "" comedy "" - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses .",neg
"drew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states .",neg
"the father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter .",neg
dorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o'hara ) .,neg
"trouble is , sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset , and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing .",neg
"so dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ; before you can say "" with cheese "" he falls for the mother-to-be .",neg
too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally .,neg
does this sound like a movie you want to see ?,neg
"without a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ; at the risk of sounding sexist , she's never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes .",neg
"she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend .",neg
but the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it .,neg
"he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .",pos
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .,pos
"the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .",pos
"the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .",pos
"brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .",pos
"hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .",pos
"when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .",pos
"the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .",pos
""" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .",pos
"it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .",pos
"even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .",pos
"although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .",pos
"the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .",pos
"scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .",pos
"nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .",pos
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .,pos
""" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him .",pos
"dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .",pos
"however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .",pos
"bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .",pos
"he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .",pos
"however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .",pos
quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .,pos
"indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .",pos
"his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .",pos
"shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .",pos
"of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .",pos
"a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .",pos
"every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .",pos
"the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .",pos
"many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .",pos
"but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .",pos
moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources .,pos
every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .,pos
"in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .",pos
"in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .",pos
jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .,pos
he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .,pos
"watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .",pos
"but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .",pos
"almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .",pos
"this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .",pos
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .,pos
"( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )",pos
"heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .",pos
"in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .",pos
"jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .",pos
"he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms .",pos
"the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil .",pos
"en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .",pos
"once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off .",pos
"this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions .",pos
"ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) .",pos
"don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .",pos
just go see the movie .,pos
"operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie .",pos
"however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .",pos
"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo .",pos
"two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .",pos
"this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . """,pos
"patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .",pos
"peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .",pos
we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .,pos
"images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image .",pos
jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo .,pos
"a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .",pos
"his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .",pos
"at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .",pos
"as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .",pos
"the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .",pos
"lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .",pos
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .,pos
"the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .",pos
this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .,pos
"peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .",pos
"( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .",pos
some colonial masters were better than others . ),pos
"the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .",pos
"production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .",pos
the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .,pos
the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .,pos
"the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .",pos
"it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .",pos
"the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .",pos
"i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .",pos
"the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .",pos
high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .,pos
"the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .",pos
"in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .",pos
""" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .",pos
it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .,pos
"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .",pos
"i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .",pos
"as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .",pos
"it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .",pos
"norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .",pos
"he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .",pos
"the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .",pos
"we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .",pos
"in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .",pos
"much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .",pos
"when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .",pos
"what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .",pos
"it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .",pos
"because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .",pos
"i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .",pos
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .,pos
"it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .",pos
"of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .",pos
it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .,pos
"in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .",pos
"even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .",pos
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .,pos
"the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .",pos
"visually , the film is very powerful .",pos
"kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .",pos
"but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .",pos
"although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .",pos
"for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .",pos
"it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .",pos
perhaps this last scene was the problem .,pos
"it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .",pos
one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .,pos
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .,pos
"her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .",pos
"but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .",pos
"and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .",pos
"written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .",pos
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .,pos
"as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .",pos
"walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .",pos
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .,pos
"she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .",pos
"she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .",pos
"and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .",pos
"thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .",pos
"the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .",pos
"ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .",pos
"walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .",pos
"when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . """,pos
"ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .",pos
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .,pos
"it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .",pos
"lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .",pos
lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .,pos
"and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .",pos
"lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .",pos
"i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .",pos
"the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .",pos
"joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .",pos
"alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .",pos
"the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .",pos
"as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .",pos
"and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .",pos
"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .",pos

the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .,pos
"it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .",pos
"sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .",pos
"quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .",pos
"but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .",pos
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .,pos
mostly it's laughable .,pos
"in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .",pos
"but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .",pos
"iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .",pos
"but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .",pos
"unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .",pos
"iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .",pos
"iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .",pos
"however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .",pos
"in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .",pos
"while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .",pos

i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad .,pos
"it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .",pos
"somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .",pos
the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .,pos
"but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .",pos
"nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .",pos
"meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .",pos
"after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .",pos
"he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .",pos
"angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .",pos
"seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .",pos
"the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .",pos
"cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .",pos
it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .,pos
"the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .",pos
"but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .",pos
"it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .",pos
they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .,pos
"filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .",pos
"based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .",pos
"most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .",pos
"nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .",pos

"review : a small but enchanting movie , "" hearts in atlantis "" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , "" stand by me "" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys .",pos
""" hearts "" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends .",pos
"unlike "" stand by me "" , there is a supernatural element to "" hearts "" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent .",pos
"like "" stand by me "" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .",pos
"yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .",pos
"more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in "" along came a spider "" and who is simply radiant here as carol .",pos
"and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen .",pos
"less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .",pos
"i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .",pos
"but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .",pos
"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .",pos
"cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .",pos
"technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .",pos
"lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .",pos
"three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .",pos
a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .,pos
opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .,pos
"in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .",pos
"real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .",pos
spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .,pos
djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .,pos
the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .,pos
"lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .",pos
"the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .",pos
"most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .",pos
it takes a pretty smart person to do that .,pos
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?,pos
what if he's also able to think on his feet ?,pos
"in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?",pos
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .,pos
"in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .",pos
"when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .",pos
"faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .",pos
"i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" ,",pos
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .,pos
"luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .",pos
"after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .",pos
"walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .",pos
"although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .",pos
"jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .",pos
"the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .",pos
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .,pos
"how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?",pos
"unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .",pos
"almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .",pos
"when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .",pos
his is an interesting character .,pos
"made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .",pos
""" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says .",pos
"when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .",pos
"soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .",pos
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .,pos
"as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .",pos
gray really lucked out with this cast .,pos
"david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .",pos
"the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .",pos
"in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .",pos
"with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .",pos
"also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .",pos
"his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .",pos
"fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .",pos
"j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .",pos
"sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .",pos
"walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .",pos
"for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .",pos
"when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .",pos
"the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .",pos
"in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .",pos
we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .,pos
"as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .",pos
both provide some pretty good entertainment .,pos
"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .",pos
critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this .,pos
"a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time .",pos
"in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer .",pos
"his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .",pos
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it .,pos
"metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again .",pos
"that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all .",pos
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg .,pos
"wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) .",pos
he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through .,pos
"he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams .",pos
"aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes .",pos
"i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .",pos
"it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .",pos
"just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .",pos
"oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! !",pos

carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .,pos
"made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .",pos
"sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .",pos
"the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .",pos
"this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode .",pos
"the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! """,pos
bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .,pos
"there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .",pos
sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .,pos
he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !,pos
the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .,pos
"there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .",pos
"williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .",pos
"the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in .",pos
"by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .",pos
this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !,pos
"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .",pos
"based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .",pos
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .,pos
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .,pos
"however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .",pos
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .,pos
"the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .",pos
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .,pos
"from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .",pos
"right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .",pos
"this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .",pos
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .,pos
the film only gets better from this point .,pos
"with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .",pos
they walk in unison and they only look forward .,pos
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .,pos

the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .,pos
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .,pos
"elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .",pos
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .,pos
"however , as the film develops so does ness .",pos
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .,pos
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .,pos
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .,pos
"sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .",pos
malone acts as a mentor to ness .,pos
"he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .",pos
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .,pos
"andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .",pos
"as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .",pos
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .,pos
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .,pos
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .,pos
"also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .",pos
">from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .",pos
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .,pos
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .,pos
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .,pos
"although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .",pos

"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .",pos
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .,pos
"aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .",pos
"while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .",pos
the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .,pos
"cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .",pos
maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .,pos
"maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .",pos
"valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .",pos
"upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .",pos
the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .,pos
along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ',pos
`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .,pos
"director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .",pos
also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .,pos
"he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .",pos
"according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .",pos
`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .,pos
one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .,pos

there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .,pos
"stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ?",pos
"he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen .",pos
"and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri .",pos
"now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl .",pos
there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially .,pos
"ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . """,pos
"the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .",pos
""" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .",pos
"a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . """,pos
"as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .",pos
"unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .",pos
"one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . """,pos
"stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .",pos
"while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .",pos
""" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .",pos
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .,pos
"janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .",pos
"stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .",pos
"the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .",pos
by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .,pos
"gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .",pos
"tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .",pos
"minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .",pos
"the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .",pos
that is until about half-way through the movie .,pos
"suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom .",pos
but this is as close as you will ever get to it .,pos
"instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . """,pos
"at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .",pos
the last half of the film is very well done .,pos
"another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .",pos
"owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : "" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . """,pos
"before this movie , sinise played mostly "" good guys , "" first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .",pos
but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .,pos
"gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .",pos
"although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .",pos

one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .,pos
"the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .",pos
sometimes the stories are compelling .,pos
sometimes they're not .,pos
"but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .",pos
star trek : insurrection is no exception .,pos
"the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .",pos
"it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .",pos
"some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .",pos
others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .,pos
i simply enjoyed the film .,pos
"insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .",pos
"of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .",pos
"murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .",pos
"the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .",pos
that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .,pos
"so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .",pos
"when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .",pos
"this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .",pos
"insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .",pos
"stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .",pos
"jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .",pos
"frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .",pos
"this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .",pos
"if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .",pos
i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .,pos
"better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?",pos
insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .,pos
"with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .",pos
i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .,pos

">from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .",pos
"1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .",pos
"as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .",pos
"not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .",pos
"as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .",pos
"the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .",pos
"however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .",pos
"and to my surprise , it grew on me .",pos
"the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .",pos
"see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .",pos
"also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .",pos
"carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .",pos
"for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .",pos
perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .,pos
"and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .",pos
"the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .",pos
"i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .",pos
"also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .",pos
"still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .",pos
"or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . )",pos
"hell , that's what i do every day .",pos
"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ?",pos
"there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ?",pos
"bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ?",pos
"it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story .",pos
"he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane .",pos
"? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers .",pos
"? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto .",pos
"? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ?",pos
""" you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ?",pos
""" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? """,pos
? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .,pos
"? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences .",pos
beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ?,pos
"his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ?",pos
"here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ?",pos
"i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ?",pos
"some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ?",pos
"much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ?",pos
"it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ?",pos
"? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .",pos
"? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning .",pos
the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ?,pos
"berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ?",pos
don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ?,pos
"oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections .",pos
is bulworth offensive ? ?,pos
i suppose some may see it that way . ?,pos
"i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ?",pos
i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ?,pos
"the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ?",pos
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ?,pos
"bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ?",pos
"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul .",pos
"the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman .",pos

"we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes .",pos
"in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .",pos
"shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .",pos
"when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .",pos
"they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done .",pos
"as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .",pos
"the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .",pos
"in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .",pos
"gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .",pos
"in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .",pos
"and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .",pos
"one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just",pos
"because you picked _today_ to clean up ? """,pos
"the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .",pos
"hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .",pos
"a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .",pos
"in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .",pos
"the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .",pos
"hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .",pos
"oh , the irony of it .",pos
"tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .",pos
"in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .",pos
"spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .",pos
"mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .",pos
"it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .",pos
"gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .",pos
"with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .",pos
the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .,pos

"movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ?",neg
"the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ?",neg

what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .,neg
"that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .",neg
"when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .",neg
so why such a seemingly high rating ?,neg
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .,neg
"first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .",neg
the sound and screen kicked ass .,neg
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .,neg
"also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .",neg
i even liked the computer-generated settings .,neg
"i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .",neg
"also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .",neg
william hurt isn't too bad either .,neg
"neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .",neg
"and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .",neg
"there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) .",neg
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .,neg
"those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .",neg
that type of moviemaking is a lost art .,neg
now for the bad news .,neg
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .,neg
"it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .",neg
""" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line .",neg
"and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .",neg
"second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .",neg
"the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .",neg
"once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .",neg
"when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' """,neg
then there's the tone of the movie .,neg
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .,neg
then it could be an adventure movie .,neg
"they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .",neg
"still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .",neg
"just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family .",neg
many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .,neg
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .,neg
"in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .",neg
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .,neg
"in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .",neg
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .,neg
"finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .",neg
the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .,neg
why ?,neg
why bother saying what year this is .,neg
just tell us it's the future .,neg
i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .,neg
setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .,neg
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .,neg
"this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .",neg
one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .,neg
"the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .",neg
this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .,neg
"but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .",neg
"still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards .",neg
"i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .",neg
"luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !",neg

i got it .,neg
"well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .",neg
this movie really sucks .,neg
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !,neg
"for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?",neg
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .,neg
"the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .",neg
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .,neg

i couldn't take it anymore .,neg

"( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .",neg

starship troopers is a bad movie .,neg
"i mean , a really , really , bad movie .",neg
"not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .",neg
"looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .",neg
"that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .",neg
"the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .",neg
"as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .",neg
"eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .",neg
"as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .",neg
""" what ? """,neg
"you say , "" laser beam weapons ?",neg
sonic weapons ?,neg
phasers ?,neg
"photon cannons ? "" .",neg
"nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !",neg
i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .,neg
"as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .",neg
"two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .",neg
"this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .",neg
"again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !",neg
"in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .",neg
"he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !",neg
"this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .",neg
"i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway .",neg
"i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .",neg
"in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .",neg

christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .,neg
and nobody wins .,neg
"the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .",neg
"i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting .",neg
christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan .,neg
he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .,neg
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .,neg
"since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die .",neg
let's stop and think about this for a second .,neg
"if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .",neg
"in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .",neg
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .,neg
you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .,neg
"this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems .",neg
"lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .",neg
"they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .",neg
the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them .,neg
"lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional .",neg
the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .,neg
"in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .",neg
"what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .",neg
"also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany .",neg
"there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot .",neg
"by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care .",neg
we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !,neg
"someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .",neg

"the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .",neg
( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ),neg
"ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself .",neg
"ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit .",neg
"he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons .",neg
insert proverbial downward spiral here .,neg
"permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story .",neg
"i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive .",neg
"as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer .",neg

watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !,neg
watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble !,neg
stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .,neg
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless .,neg
when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?,neg
"and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ?",neg
"in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself .",neg
"if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man .",neg
( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .,neg
is this hollywood . . . california ? ),neg
i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .,neg
of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .,neg
"so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects .",neg

"similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .",neg
these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic .,neg
"this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's "" dawson's creek , "" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .",neg
other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .,neg
"there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either .",neg
"everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .",neg
this is certainly missable .,neg
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .,neg
"the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .",neg
"the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .",neg
"if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .",neg
"cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .",neg
"and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough .",neg
cage should have known what he was getting himself into .,neg
"he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .",neg
the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance .,neg
"in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .",neg
that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .,neg
"while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .",neg
"audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .",neg
"in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .",neg
"director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .",neg
what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense .,neg
"a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .",neg
"if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up .",neg
"at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .",neg
"their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .",neg
"in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .",neg
it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .,neg
"while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .",neg
"his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .",neg

critique : this movie just didn't scare me one bit .,neg
"sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us .",neg
"well , this film didn't do much for me .",neg
"and they might as well have called it the "" haunting of lily taylor "" , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place .",neg
"don't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard "" comic relief "" , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension .",neg
"neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy .",neg
"it's all too sad , cause certainly the "" idea "" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ?",neg
"well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry .",neg
"see it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining .",neg

"that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression .",neg
"indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel .",neg
"the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians .",neg
"the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas .",neg
"well , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced .",neg
here's the story .,neg
"cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov .",neg
"( oh , how witty . )",neg
"she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film .",neg
"cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again .",neg
"a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula .",neg
"at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater .",neg
how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ?,neg

how can a french guy have a bad french accent ?,neg

""" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .",neg
"it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .",neg
there are certainly better things you can do with your time .,neg
"actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments .",neg
"the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer .",neg
but he's afflicted with loser-itis .,neg
"dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him .",neg
"truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun .",neg
this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him .,neg
"we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor .",neg
"however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs .",neg
"as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed .",neg
"he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah .",neg
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation .,neg
"with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him .",neg
"however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges .",neg
goats beware !,neg
"he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies .",neg
what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich .,neg
"equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black .",neg

"with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination .",neg

"in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical .",neg

"and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty .",neg
"although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way .",neg
"this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there .",neg

"on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .",neg
"branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped .",neg
"smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others .",neg
i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie .,neg
"then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh",neg

"lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss .",neg
"salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english .",neg
"she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas .",neg
"since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films .",neg
"she stands 5'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother .",neg

in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa .,neg
"the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government .",neg
"after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest .",neg
"when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone .",neg
"many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that .",neg
"that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt .",neg
"however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement .",neg
"after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight .",neg
"until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon .",neg
"unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script .",neg
"sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be .",neg
"on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl .",neg
"on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible .",neg
"however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time .",neg

""" it's just . . .",neg
the way . . .,neg
"we are . """,neg
"--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl .",neg
i'll admit it . . .,neg
i love superman iii .,neg
"i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise .",neg
"supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii .",neg
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time .,neg
"as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives .",neg
ok . . .,neg
what ?,neg
"so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ?",neg
were they living there before krypton exploded ?,neg
"how do you get to "" inner space "" ?",neg
"this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world .",neg
how do they know where superman went ?,neg
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ?,neg
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me .,neg
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron .,neg
"one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art .",neg
"kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city .",neg
"in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . .",neg
"in three days time , or something .",neg
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world .,neg
"the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) .",neg
"selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination .",neg
"selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) .",neg
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives .,neg
ok . . .,neg
huh ?,neg
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ?,neg
attention movie : explain yourself !,neg
"i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much .",neg
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to .,neg
"knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school .",neg
"she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ?",neg
"lois lane's sister , lucy .",neg
"ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now .",neg
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . .,neg
"complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) .",neg
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks .,neg
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense .,neg
there is some credit to give to the film however .,neg
"one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done .",neg
"also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools .",neg
"hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) .",neg
then there were numerous little things that bothered me .,neg
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . .,neg
"the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .",neg
"throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .",neg
"fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose .",neg
"but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .",neg
and that's precisely where this film fails .,neg
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .,neg
"it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .",neg
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .,neg
"here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . """,neg
"i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .",neg
"the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .",neg
"explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd .",neg
"explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . """,neg
"whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .",neg
"that's as deep as it gets , folks .",neg
"there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .",neg
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .,neg
"my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .",neg
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .,neg
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .,neg
"any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .",neg
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .,neg
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .,neg
"jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .",neg
cut to random guy with eye patch . . .,neg

iguana comes into focus .,neg
"wow , man .",neg
"when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .",neg
"there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .",neg
"and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . .",neg
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .,neg
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .,neg
"some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .",neg
"someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , "" shut the hell up ! "" , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen .",neg
"as bad as "" mimic "" was , it definitly scared me .",neg
